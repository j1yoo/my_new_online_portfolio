Before joining NTHU, I was a visiting postdoctoral fellow at the [Center of Business Education and Research](https://cber.shanghai.nyu.edu/), <a href='https://shanghai.nyu.edu/'>New York University (NYU) Shanghai</a> where I was advised by <a href='https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/yuxin-chen'>Yuxin Chen</a>. I received my Ph.D. from the <a href='https://btm.kaist.ac.kr/en/'>School of Business and Technology Management</a>, <a href='https://www.business.kaist.edu/'>KAIST College of Business</a>, <a href='https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/'>KAIST</a> where I was advised by <a href='https://wjkim.kaist.ac.kr/'>Wonjoon Kim</a>.

My research interests span innovation, information systems, and marketing, with a specific focus on the societal and economic impacts of emerging technologies. Methodologically, I focus on causal inference, applying techniques that include quasi-experimental methods like regression discontinuity (RD) designs and synthetic difference in differences (SDiD), as well as causal machine learning (ML) approaches such as double-debiased machine learning (DML). I also have extensive experience designing and conducting large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by engaging in industry collaborations. For more detailed information on my publications and ongoing projects, please visit the [research]({% link _pages/publications.md %}) section of my webpage.

Students who are interested in pursuing research under my supervision are strongly encouraged to have first completed at least one of my courses. Familiarity with the material from [ISS5096](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18S9kzicR84sdMbW2mkB8oOf4vjOEzI-E/view?usp=sharing) is particularly beneficial.
